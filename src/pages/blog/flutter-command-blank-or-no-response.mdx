when i run

```cmd
flutter upgrade
```
i'm not get any response, it's like blank or waiting forever

base on https://www.appsloveworld.com/flutter/100/8/flutter-doctor-hangs-on-start-no-output so the solution is delete folder in your flutter SDK path 
```cmd
rm -rf flutter/bin/cache
```
then check it
```cmd
flutter --version
```
